- after stopTicking is called, there should be no more interval

-
> ClearInterval is not working...
this.myInt = {id: 0}... the interval is being overwritten...
...I don't think there's any need for an ID!

> Replace with promises or a while loop: TimerBox->startTicking() aka
 ...if (!eachTicking || !myInt) {
  actions.setTickingTrue(id);
  // count down, myInt
  this.myInt = {id: 0};...
