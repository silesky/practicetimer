- ClearInterval is not working...
this.myInt = {id: 0}... the interval is being overwritten...
...I don't think there's any need for an ID!

testing:
- if current timer is clicked, wait one second, current time should be less than 1....
  - if PausePlay (w/ id = 1) has a simulated click
  - wait 1 sec
  - then store.getState().[1].time < 1
